## Browsing GitHub Repositories from Colab

Colab also supports special URLs that link directly to a GitHub browser for any user/organization, repository, or branch. For example:

- http://colab.research.google.com/github will give you a general github browser, where you can search for any github organization or username.
- http://colab.research.google.com/github/sabsdrive01/AI/ will open the repository browser for the ``googlecolab`` organization. Replace ``googlecolab`` with any other github org or user to see their repositories.
- http://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/sabsdrive01/AI/ will let you browse the main branch of the ``colabtools`` repository within the ``googlecolab`` organization. Substitute any user/org and repository to see its contents.
- http://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/sabsdrive01/AI/blob/master will let you browse ``master`` branch of the ``colabtools`` repository within the ``googlecolab`` organization. (don't forget the ``blob`` here!) You can specify any valid branch for any valid repository.
