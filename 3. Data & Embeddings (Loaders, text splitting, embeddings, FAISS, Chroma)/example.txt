Force majeure, French for "superior force," is a contractual provision designed to protect parties from liability when extraordinary, unforeseeable events beyond their reasonable control prevent them from fulfilling their obligations. Such events, often called "acts of God," can include natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, hurricanes), as well as human-caused disruptions like wars, strikes, pandemics, or government actions. To successfully invoke force majeure, the affected party typically must demonstrate that the event was unforeseeable, external, and rendered performance impossible or illegal, not merely more difficult or expensive
